# # ------ Exercise 1
# print "Hello world!"
# print "Hello again"
# print "I like typing this."
# print "This is fun."
# print 'Yay! printing.'
# print "I'd much rather You 'not'."
# print 'I "said" do not touch this.'
# print "Cats are awesome!"
# # print "cats are better than dogs!"

# # -------- Exercise 2
# # A comment, this is so you can read your program later.
# # Anything after the # is ignored by python.

# print "I could have code like this." # and the comment after is ignored

# # You can also use a comment to "disable" or comment out a piece of code:
# # print "This won't run."

# print "This will run."

# --------- Exercise 3
# prints "I will now count my chickens"
print "I will now count my chickens:"

# adds 25+30 and divides the answer by 6 and prints the answer = 30
print "Hens", 25 + 30 / 6

# * and % take precedence over -, so we first evaluate 25 * 3 % 4.  * and % have the same priority and associativity from left to right, so we evaluate from left to right, starting with 25 * 3. This yields 75. Now we evaluate 75 % 4, yielding 3. Finally, 100 - 3 is 97. 
print "Roosters", 100 - 25 * 3 % 4

# prints "Now I will count the eggs"
print "Now I will count the eggs:"

# the answer is 7. The % (modulo) operator yields the remainder from the division of the first argument by the second. The numeric arguments are first converted to a common type. A zero right argument raises the ZeroDivisionError exception. The arguments may be floating point numbers, e.g., 3.14%0.7 equals 0.34 (since 3.14 equals 4*0.7 + 0.34.) The modulo operator always yields a result with the same sign as its second operand (or zero); the absolute value of the result is strictly smaller than the absolute value of the second operand [2].
print 3 + 2 + 1 - 5 + 4 % 2 - 1 / 4 + 6
print "Is it true that 3 + 2 < 5 - 7?"
print 3 + 2 < 5 - 7
print "What is 3 + 2?", 3 + 2
print "What is 5 - 7?", 5 - 7
print "Oh, that's why it's False."
print "How about some more."
print "Is it greater?", 5 > -2
print "Is it greater or equal?", 5 >= -2
print "Is it less or equal?", 5 <= -2
